#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Zichao Wei, a passionate seeker of knowledge, dedicated to exploring and innovating in the field of Linguistics. My research interests include Quantitative Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, and Psycholinguistics (Eye-tracking). In summary, I hope to conduct interesting research in the interdisciplinary field of language and society, as well as the physiological mechanisms of human language.

I hope we can achieve the greatness of Nicolas Bourbaki by utilizing various aspects of language science and technology to reconstruct a new field of linguistics.
