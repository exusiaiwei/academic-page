abstract: Linguistic landscape is an important field in sociolinguistic research.
  Eye tracking technology is a common technology in psychological research. There
  are few cases of using eye movement to study linguistic landscape. This paper uses
  eye tracking technology to study the actual fixation of the linguistic landscape
  and finds that in the two dimensions of fixation time and fixation times, the fixation
  of native Chinese speakers to the linguistic landscape is higher than that of the
  general landscape. This paper argues that this phenomenon is due to the higher information
  density of linguistic landscapes. At the same time, the article also discusses other
  possible reasons for this phenomenon.
